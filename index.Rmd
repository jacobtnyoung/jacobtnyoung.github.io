I am an Associate Professor in the [School of Criminology and Criminal Justice](https://ccj.asu.edu/) at [Arizona State University](https://asu.edu). My research focuses on **network criminology**! Specifically, how ideas from network science can be applied to problems in criminology and criminal justice.
