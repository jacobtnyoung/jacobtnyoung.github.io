### About me...

<br>

*Hi there!* 

<br>
I am an Associate Professor in the [School of Criminology and Criminal Justice](https://ccj.asu.edu/) at [Arizona State University](https://asu.edu). My research focuses on [**network criminology**](https://jacobtnyoung.github.io/Networks.html)! Specifically, how ideas from network science can be applied to problems in criminology and criminal justice.  

I teach two courses that pertain to this research focus:  

  * An [analysis of network data](https://jacobtnyoung.github.io/SAND/) course  
  
  * A [network theory](https://jacobtnyoung.github.io/NetworkCriminology/) course  

<br>

I am also the  Associate Director for the [Center for Correctional Solutions](https://ccj.asu.edu/ccs).

<br>

*And*, I am the Curriculum Coordinator for the [Institute for Social Science Research](https://issr.asu.edu).    

<br>

*Thanks for stopping by!!!*
