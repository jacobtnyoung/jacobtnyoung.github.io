### About me...

<br>

#### [Curriculum Vitae](https://github.com/jacobtnyoung/jacobtnyoung.github.io/raw/master/CV_YOUNG_distribute.pdf)   

<br>
I am an Associate Professor in the [School of Criminology and Criminal Justice](https://ccj.asu.edu/) at [Arizona State University](https://asu.edu). My research focuses on a variety of topics including: [**Network Criminology**](https://jacobtnyoung.github.io/site_pages/Networks.html) and [**Data Science**](https://jacobtnyoung.github.io/OpenCrimPhx/).

<br>

<br>

### Research & Teaching

<br>

#### *Network Criminology*

[**Network Criminology**](https://jacobtnyoung.github.io/site_pages/Networks.html) is the application of ideas from network science to problems in criminology and criminal justice.  [*Learn more*](https://jacobtnyoung.github.io/site_pages/Networks.html). How do beliefs about technology (e.g. body-worn cameras) spread among police officers? How is power defined and distributed among incarcerated men and incarcerated women? These are all questions that require a network perspective to not only answer the question, but be able to ask it in the first place. To see the work I have done in this area, see my [Writing](https://jacobtnyoung.github.io/site_pages/Writing.html) page.  

I teach two courses that pertain to a focus on [**Network Criminology**](https://jacobtnyoung.github.io/site_pages/Networks.html):  

  + An [analysis of network data](https://jacobtnyoung.github.io/SAND/) course  
  
  + A [network theory](https://jacobtnyoung.github.io/NetworkCriminology/) course  

<br>

#### *Data Science*

*But wait, there's more!* I have recently started tinkering around with data science (because it is awesome!). Specifically, I have created a site to examine the Phoenix, AZ open data portal. The site, [Open Criminology Phoenix (OCP)](https://jacobtnyoung.github.io/OpenCrimPhx/), explores different questions using these data. If you are wondering what is happening with crime in Phoenix, [Open Criminology Phoenix (OCP)](https://jacobtnyoung.github.io/OpenCrimPhx/) is the place to start!

### Mentoring

I have had the opportunity to mentor some incredible students in my career. If you are interested in who they are and they work they do, check them out at my [Mentoring](https://jacobtnyoung.github.io/site_pages/Mentoring.html) page.

### Service

*And*, I am the Director of Curriculum for the [Institute for Social Science Research](https://issr.asu.edu).
