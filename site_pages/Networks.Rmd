### [Statistical Analysis of Network Data (SAND)](https://jacobtnyoung.github.io/SAND/)

I teach a course on the statistical analysis of networks which provides a survey of the various tools for used in network analysis. The overarching goal of the course is that, upon completion, students will be capable of developing research questions from a network perspective and incorporating network-based tools in their own research. The course is designed to be primarily methodological, dedicating the majority of the time to working through the mechanics of network-based tools. Students will also gain experience with R, a commonly used software program for network data management, analysis, and visualization.

### [Network Criminology](https://jacobtnyoung.github.io/NetworkCriminology/)

I currently teach a course called *Network Criminology* that seeks to educate students on the application of network science to problems in criminology and criminal justice. The overarching goal of the course is to provide students with the tools for thinking about problems in criminology and criminal justice through a network lens (i.e. viewing systems as made up of heterogeneous actors connected through different types of relations). This is done by providing an introduction to a broad range of concepts from a what might be considered “classic” or “foundational” works in network science.

Even if you are not taking the course, feel free to browse the [syllabus](https://github.com/jacobtnyoung/NetworkCriminology/raw/main/_files/CRJ_523_Networks_SYLLABUS.pdf) or take a look at the [course page](https://jacobtnyoung.github.io/NetworkCriminology/). As always, I welcome any feedback on suggestions you may have for improving the course!
